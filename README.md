# cardiac-disease-using-phonocardiogram-signal

## Description

A modified ResNet model to detect cardiac diseases by converting phonocardiogram signal into spectrogram.

Please find the code and the dataset for your experiment. 
Hope you find it usefull. 
Experiment with the code and if possible please try to cite the paper using:
